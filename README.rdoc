This is a simple app that was tasked with doing the following:

* Create a rails app that lists "Quotes"
* Populate 100 fake (different) quotes that are db:seed'd
* Add a search bar, and search for the Quotes
* Display the results on the screen

* search lower and upper case
* search partial words
* should tell me the resulting count
* use base stuff OR pg_search
